=== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ===
SYSTEM          	Can you tell me what types of movies you like?          	OTHER
USER	I really like comedies.   ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY           	3,3,3,4
SYSTEM          	ok, why do you like comedies? OTHER
USER	I like to laugh. I like the lightheartedness of it, you know, nothing too serious, a true escape from everyday life. And just puts you in a good mood, and that's how I would prefer to be.  	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY         	3,3,3,4
SYSTEM          	got it, can you name a specific movie you really liked?           	OTHER

SYSTEM          	ok, why do you like that movie?           	OTHER
USER	Oh gosh. It's like I'ts perfect. It's a mockumentary style film and they are mocking the dog show world. So, the dog show world that they show is like a carbon copy of the real thing because it's inherently funny, so they don't have to really max with it. And a lot of the player they it there's a script for the movie but it's also ad libed.           	ENTITY_OTHER+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 	3,3,4,3
USER	It's just hilarious. It's so original.           	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES    	3,3,3,4
USER	So much, so different, and just so funny. It makes you laugh every time you watch it.         	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES    	3,3,3,4
SYSTEM          	ok, would you say you enjoy satire?           	ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY         	
USER	Yeah.	OTHER 3,3,4,4
SYSTEM          	ok, can you name a film you dislike? 	OTHER
USER	Sure, Bounty Hunter.	ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES   	3,3,3,4
SYSTEM          	why didn't you like that movie?            	OTHER
USER	It was supposed to be a comedy, and not only was it not funny, it was confusing what they were going for. I think it was miscast.           	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES    	3,3,2,3
USER	It's Jennifer Aniston and I can't even think of his name, but somebody who I don't really care for. But I do like Jennifer usually, and it wasn't a good fit for her. Neither role really fit the actor, like they were sort of playing against type in both roles. I think it was kind of supposed to be almost like a almost like a buddy comedy, but or Cuz it was really focused on two people, but not really buddies, but they were in conflict. It wasn't funny.   ENTITY_PREFERENCE+PERSON         	3,3,2,3
USER	It kind of had like a more dramatic feel to it because it wasn't funny. It was just It was odd. Really.         	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES    	4,4,2,4
SYSTEM          	was the acting bad?  	OTHER
USER	It wasn't great. It was not great.           	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES    	3,3,2,2
SYSTEM          	ok, can you tell me have you watched the movie the shawshank redemption?  	ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES   	
USER	Oh, yes.          	OTHER 3,3,3,3
SYSTEM          	do you like that movie?            	OTHER
USER	It's a excellent movie.   ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES    	3,3,3,5
SYSTEM          	ok, what about the movie did you enjoy?        	OTHER
USER	It really has a different feel to it. It's despite them being, you know, prisoners, they create very endearing characters who you rooting for, who you want to see have a better life. It is a You're transported to a different time so you can sort of capture what was going on better.  	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES    	3,3,3,5
USER	It very moving, it very and and it's very touching which usually does not happen with something that's sort of a prison drama. I don't you ever really view them as true prisoners some of whom shouldn't really have gotten as steep of sentences as they do or like somebody who walks who was there far too long for what it sounded like he was in for and then couldn't live in the real world having been locked up so long. So, it's it's it's a it's just a it's a excellent film.     	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES           	3,3,3,5
USER	with amazing acting, wonderful direction and it's just It's very special. It it really is. It's it's one of those wonder you look back and you wonder why didn't want to win Oscar.  ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES    	3,3,5,5
