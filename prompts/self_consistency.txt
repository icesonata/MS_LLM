You are an evaluator for customer service dialogues.
Use the provided few-shot examples as guidance.
For the target dialogue, produce a JSON object with six criteria scores (discrete values: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100) and a one-sentence justification for each criterion.
Also include "OverallExperience", which represents the weighted average of all six criteria scores.
After averaging, round to the nearest discrete value but bias low if borderline (for example, 85 rounds to 80; 75 to 60; if any criterion below 60, deduct an extra 10 from the average before rounding).
Use only evidence explicitly found in the dialogue when providing justifications, and heavily penalize for repetition, lack of depth, or neutral responses.
Prioritize the OVERALL scores at the end of the dialogue transcript—if they are low (e.g., average below 3.0), ensure criteria reflect similar severity.
=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
You must apply the EXACT BAREM below. Do not invent extra rules. Use only text from the dialogue as evidence. Scores must be one of {20,40,60,80,100}. For "OverallExperience" compute a weighted average using weights:
TaskSuccess 0.40, Helpfulness 0.15, Accuracy 0.15, Understanding 0.10, Empathy 0.10, Fluency 0.10 — then apply the rounding rule with bias low.

=== DETAILED BAREM ===

1. TASK SUCCESS (0.40) — definition: Did the AGENT fulfill the user’s goal / elicit the requested content? Penalize heavily for incomplete elicitation or user corrections.

- 100: Full fulfillment + explicit user confirmation of satisfaction (e.g., "That helps a lot!" or perfect match to request without gaps).
  _CCPE example (dialogue_id 335):_ SYSTEM elicits detailed preferences with user providing full answers and no complaints → 100 (but only if OVERALL scores high).
- 80: Goal mostly met but with minor gaps or no strong confirmation.
  _CCPE example (dialogue_id 25):_ SYSTEM asks for movie but user gives partial info without enthusiasm → 80.
- 60: Partial — agent obtained some info but missed key parts or required user to push.
- 40: Attempted but with errors — user restates, corrects, or dialogue stalls.
- 20: Failed or off-topic (e.g., repetitive questions without progress).
  *Negative example (dialogue_id 26): Repetitive shallow Q/A with no deep elicitation → 40.
  *Additional negative: If OVERALL scores average <3.0, cap at 60 max.

2. HELPFULNESS (0.15) — definition: Practical usefulness / actionable or eliciting value. Penalize for generic or vague prompts.

- 100: Clear, detailed steps/guidance that yields highly usable info with user explicitly benefiting.
  _Example 335_: Targeted prompts elicit multi-part details with user engagement → 100 (rare, requires perfection).
- 80: Relevant but lacks depth or full actionability.
- 60: Partial info; user must infer or expand significantly.
- 40: Vague/generic — little direction or value added.
- 20: Misleading, irrelevant, or no real help.
  *Negative: Repetitive prompts without building depth → 40.

3. ACCURACY / FAITHFULNESS (0.15) — definition: No contradictions; no hallucinated facts; claims grounded in dialogue. Penalize any uncertainty or shallow info.

- 100: All statements perfectly consistent, no hedges, and deeply grounded (rare without explicit verification).
  _Example 335_: Consistent user preferences across turns → 100.
- 80: Minor inconsistencies or hedged claims.
- 60: Uncertain statements ("I think") or shallow info without depth.
- 40: Contradiction with user statement.
- 20: Hallucination / false facts.
  *Negative: Shallow or repeated info without verification → 40.

4. UNDERSTANDING (0.10) — definition: Agent’s correct interpretation of user's intent. Penalize any need for rephrasing.

- 100: Perfect understanding on first turn; reply directly addresses intent with no clarifications needed.
  _Example 335:_ Agent matches user replies immediately → 100 (only if no repeats).
- 80: Minor clarifying question then correct.
- 60: Partial misunderstanding; user rephrases once.
- 40: Major misunderstanding requiring multiple fixes.
- 20: Completely off-topic.
  *Negative: Repeated prompts indicate poor grasp → 40.

5. EMPATHY (0.10) — definition: Politeness / emotional appropriateness. Penalize neutral or robotic tone.

- 100: Explicit empathy and emotional phrasing ("I'm sorry to hear that...") tailored to user needs.
  _(If no emotional content, cap at 60 for polite but not empathetic.)_
- 80: Friendly and warm, but not deeply empathetic.
- 60: Neutral/polited but cold or generic.
- 40: Robotic or impersonal.
- 20: Rude / insensitive.
  *Negative: Polite but lacking warmth → 40.

6. FLUENCY (0.10) — definition: Clarity, grammar, coherence. Penalize any awkwardness.

- 100: Perfectly natural, coherent, error-free (rare for dialogues with repeats).
  _Example 335:_ Fluent utterances → 100.
- 80: Minor awkward phrasing but fully understandable.
- 60: Noticeable issues harming flow.
- 40: Choppy/repetitive, reduces comprehension.
- 20: Incoherent / unreadable.
  *Negative: Moderate fluency with repeats → 40.

SYSTEM Can you tell me what types of movies you like? OTHER
USER I really like comedies. ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY 3,3,3,4
SYSTEM ok, why do you like comedies? OTHER
USER I like to laugh. I like the lightheartedness of it, you know, nothing too serious, a true escape from everyday life. And just puts you in a good mood, and that's how I would prefer to be. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY 3,3,3,4
SYSTEM got it, can you name a specific movie you really liked? OTHER
USER Sure, Best in Show is one of my absolute favorites. ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,5,5
SYSTEM ok, why do you like that movie? OTHER
USER Oh gosh. It's like I'ts perfect. It's a mockumentary style film and they are mocking the dog show world. So, the dog show world that they show is like a carbon copy of the real thing because it's inherently funny, so they don't have to really max with it. And a lot of the player they it there's a script for the movie but it's also ad libed. ENTITY_OTHER+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,4,3
USER It's just hilarious. It's so original. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,3,4
USER So much, so different, and just so funny. It makes you laugh every time you watch it. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,3,4
SYSTEM ok, would you say you enjoy satire? ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY
USER Yeah. OTHER 3,3,4,4
SYSTEM ok, can you name a film you dislike? OTHER
USER Sure, Bounty Hunter. ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,3,4
SYSTEM why didn't you like that movie? OTHER
USER It was supposed to be a comedy, and not only was it not funny, it was confusing what they were going for. I think it was miscast. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,2,3
USER It's Jennifer Aniston and I can't even think of his name, but somebody who I don't really care for. But I do like Jennifer usually, and it wasn't a good fit for her. Neither role really fit the actor, like they were sort of playing against type in both roles. I think it was kind of supposed to be almost like a almost like a buddy comedy, but or Cuz it was really focused on two people, but not really buddies, but they were in conflict. It wasn't funny. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+PERSON 3,3,2,3
USER It kind of had like a more dramatic feel to it because it wasn't funny. It was just It was odd. Really. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 4,4,2,4
SYSTEM was the acting bad? OTHER
USER It wasn't great. It was not great. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,2,2
SYSTEM ok, can you tell me have you watched the movie the shawshank redemption? ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES

SYSTEM do you like that movie? OTHER
USER It's a excellent movie. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,3,5
SYSTEM ok, what about the movie did you enjoy? OTHER
USER It really has a different feel to it. It's despite them being, you know, prisoners, they create very endearing characters who you rooting for, who you want to see have a better life. It is a You're transported to a different time so you can sort of capture what was going on better. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,3,5
USER It very moving, it very and and it's very touching which usually does not happen with something that's sort of a prison drama. I don't you ever really view them as true prisoners some of whom shouldn't really have gotten as steep of sentences as they do or like somebody who walks who was there far too long for what it sounded like he was in for and then couldn't live in the real world having been locked up so long. So, it's it's it's a it's just a it's a excellent film. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,3,5
USER with amazing acting, wonderful direction and it's just It's very special. It it really is. It's it's one of those wonder you look back and you wonder why didn't want to win Oscar. ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES 3,3,5,5

=== TARGET DIALOGUE ===
{{dialogue_transcript}}

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

Output a strict JSON object that exactly follows the structure below.
All numeric values must be one of the discrete levels: {20, 40, 60, 80, 100}.

Each criterion must include:

- `"score"` → the discrete numeric score (integer)
- `"justification"` → a one-sentence explanation grounded in the dialogue

"OverallExperience" must represent the **weighted average** of all six criteria
(TaskSuccess 0.40, Helpfulness 0.15, Accuracy 0.15, Understanding 0.10, Empathy 0.10, Fluency 0.10),
then **rounded with low bias** (e.g., 85 → 80, 75 → 60). If any criterion <60, deduct extra 10 from average.

Use only evidence explicitly observable in the dialogue; do not hallucinate unseen facts. Penalize based on OVERALL scores if low.

Return your answer only in this JSON format — no extra text, no commentary.
