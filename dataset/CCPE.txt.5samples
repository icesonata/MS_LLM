SYSTEM	What kind of movies to you like, and why do you like this type of movie?	OTHER	
USER	I really like dramas. I don't like every single drama but I do like that that they can take sort of a slice of life and make something special out of it. Dramas are usually the most realistic and the most ordinary type of movies that you can go and see. So, there are makers who can make something special out of sort of an ordinary is quite an accomplishment and enjoyable to watch.	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY	3,3,3

SYSTEM	What do you dislike about this movie? Please give me 2 reasons.	OTHER	
USER	Sure. It is an epic film, and to me, it doesn't do well with its epicness. It is rather ordinary, and the two main characters, while likable, would have been better suited for something of a smaller scale, despite the overall grand nature of the story they were trying to tell in the historical aspect. And the other thing is that it just	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,3,3
USER	It's It's so such a over hyped movie and it's just, I don't know, ordinary. It's not something that's overly enjoyable and it's nothing that you want to keep watching over and over again. It having a good soundtrack or two likable characters out of, I don't know, a hundred isn't something that you should should get loaded over so much.	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,3,2

It is a good a really good continuation of the of the story and it's a a nice sort of second look into the characters that we met the first time but in a really showing them in a completely different not a completely different make but in a different light that we saw	ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,3,3

SYSTEM	What do you like about this movie? Please give me 2 reasons.	OTHER	
USER	Sure. It is Star Wars mythology and the world that they create is really something special, and this definitely continues that. The other thing is that it's just It's quite a world that they've created, so it's exciting. So it really is a nice escape, and it's incredibly detailed, so it helps to sort of create this other world. It's a lot to follow, but it is enjoyable.	ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,3,3

SYSTEM	Well, tell me why do you like art house films?	ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY	
USER	I like them because usually there's a lot of symbolism and there's a lot of thought that goes into every scene usually things are there for a reason and put there for purpose unlike your typical action film that doesn't really have that.	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY	4,3,3

USER	The Fall.	ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,4,3
SYSTEM	alright, Why is that your favorite movie	OTHER	
USER	Because I love the cinematography. It's beautifully filmed. It was filmed, I think in over 20 countries. It was filmed by a director called Tarsem Singh, if I say his name right. And I believe he financed most of it. It was sort of his pet project, and I like the story. But it's just beautifully	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	4,3,3
USER	A particular movie, I can't think off the top of my head, but in general I'm not a huge fan of comedies. Well, actually I can think of one. I don't really care for like Superbad or movies like that.	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY	4,3,3

SYSTEM	What is it about this kind of movies that you like or dislike?	OTHER	
USER	The Martian was a little slow, I will have to say. It wasn't terrible or anything. I like sci-fi movies, but it was just slow. It got a little boring in parts. If I was going to pick a sci-fi movie that came out around that same time period, I would've picked Interstellar. I think it had a better story and more meaning. And just was more interesting	ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,3,3

SYSTEM	It set the standard for action computer graphics. Everything after that had to at least live up that the original Matrix.	ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	
USER	That's true, It changed a lot of for a long time how action scenes were shot especially with that slow motion 360 cam. Now we've kind of gone the opposite where it's like Jason Bourne movies where everything is so quick cut and you can't tell what's going on. I wish we could go back to the Matrix.
